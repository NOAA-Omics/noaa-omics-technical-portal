- [Better Biomolecular Ocean Practices (BeBOP)](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON):
UN Ocean Decade project aiming to achieve increased comparability between Biomolecular Ocean Practices.
Goal is to create machine-readable protocol documents where changes can be tracked, assigned DOIs, and linked to associated datasets.
