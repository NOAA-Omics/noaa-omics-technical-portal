# 'Omics Protocols

## Protocol Standards

- [BeBOP Protocol Standard](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON)<br>
Better Biomolecular Ocean Practices (BeBOP) is a UN Ocean Decade project under the Ocean Biomolecular Observing Network (OBON) program. It aims to achieve increased comparability between Biomolecular Ocean Practices with the goal to create machine-readable protocol documents that have version control, assigned DOIs, and are linked to associated datasets.

## Sampling and Laboratory Protocols

- [NOAA/PMEL Protocols](https://github.com/NOAA-PMEL/Ocean-Molecular-Ecology#pcr-protocols)<br>
Protocols from the NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) Ocean Molecular Ecology group, including procedures for eDNA sample collection, extraction, and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), as well as bioinformatic and data analysis tools.
- [NOAA/AOML Protocols](https://github.com/aomlomics/protocols)<br>
Protocols from the NOAA Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML), including procedures for eDNA sampling, extraction, metabarcoding library prep, and metagenomic sequencing.
- [MBARI Protocols](https://mbari-bog.github.io/MBON-Protocols/)<br>
Protocols used by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) Biological Oceanography Group, including Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) protocols for eDNA sampling, extraction, PCR, DNA cleanup, and bioinformatics.
- [NCOG Protocols](https://calcofi.org/data/marine-ecosystem-data/e-dna/)<br>
NOAA-California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) Ocean Genomics (NCOG) project protocols,  which include eDNA sampling, DNA/RNA extraction, amplicon library prep, and bioinformatics pipelines.
- [WC-OBON Protocols](https://github.com/marinednadude/west-coast-obon-protocols)<br>
The West Coast Ocean Biomolecular Observation Network (WC-OBON) is a partnership between [many organizations](https://evsatt.github.io/WC-OBON_Website/#partners) developed as part of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. eDNA primers and PCR protocols for a broad array of taxa, including microbes, plankton, fishes, mammals, and cephalopods.
