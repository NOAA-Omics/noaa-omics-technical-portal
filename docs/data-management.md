# Data Management and Standards

## Data Management Guides

- [NOAA 'Omics Data Management Guide](https://noaa-omics-dmg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)<br>
This guide helps 'Omics data users decide which data goes to which repositories (NCEI, NCBI, etc.), and how to deposit their data so that it will be FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable), including following community standards for raw data, processed data, and contextual metadata and environmental data.‚Äù

## Standardization

- [Standardizing Marine Biological Data Working Group (SMBD) to mobilize marine biological data](https://github.com/ioos/bio_data_guide)<br>
Resources and standards forum for mobilizing biological data into the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS). External to NOAA, the Standardizing Marine Biological Data (SMBD) Working Group provides information on aligning marine biological data to [Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org/) and, ultimately, OBIS.
